Teamcity CI
===========

### Automation

- [DevOps Bash tools](https://github.com/HariSekhon/DevOps-Bash-tools):
  - `teamcity.sh` - create your own [TeamCity](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/) cluster in 1 command
    - auto-loads VCS root to this repo which then loads a dozen more buildTypes and VCS roots
  - `teamcity_api.sh` - query the [TeamCity API](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/teamcity/rest-api.html), handling authentication and other details
  - `jenkins.sh` - one-touch [Jenkins CI](https://jenkins.io/) instance
     - auto-loads and builds a pipeline from `Jenkinsfile` if available
  - `concourse.sh` - one-touch [Concourse CI](https://concourse-ci.org/) instance
    - auto-loads and builds a pipeline from `.concourse.yml` if available
  - `gocd.sh` - one-touch [GoCD CI](https://www.gocd.org/) cluster
    - auto-loads and builds a pipeline from a config repo if available


### TeamCity Configs

TeamCity Project, VCS and BuiltType configs in XML, JSON and Kotlin formats:

### Docker Images

The original docker image in here is deprecated: use the newer official JetBrains Teamcity docker images from DockerHub:

### All the CI Systems

All my [major GitHub repos](https://github.com/HariSekhon) contain fully working live configs for just about every major CI system out there:

##### Local CI:

You can boot any of these CI and run the repo's build with a single short one-word command using the scripts above.

- [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) - `Jenkinsfile` at the top of each repo
- [Concourse](https://concourse-ci.org/) - `.concourse.yml` at the top of each repo
- [GoCD](https://www.gocd.org/) - `setup/gocd_config_repo.json` in each repo
- [TeamCity](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/) - `.teamcity.vcs.json` in each repo
