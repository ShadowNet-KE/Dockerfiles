Jenkins inbound-agent + Docker
==============================

Jenkins inbound agent + docker packages installed to be able to use the `docker` and `docker-compose` commands (combine with mounting docker socket).

This is known as Docker-out-of-Docker (DooD), which allows running docker commands inside the Jenkins agent's CI/CD builds, creating sibling docker containers.

```
docker run -ti -u 0 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock harisekhon/jenkins-agent-docker bash

# inside the jenkins agent you can then run docker commands like normal and in your CI/CD builds
docker ps
...
```

This docker image solves the lack of `docker` command availability in the stock [jenkins/inbound-agent](https://hub.docker.com/r/jenkins/inbound-agent/) image (see issues [#215](https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker-inbound-agent/issues/215) and [#222](https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker-inbound-agent/issues/222))

```
/home/jenkins/agent/workspace/<name>@tmp/durable-2f6d01c2/script.sh: docker: not found
```

If doing DooD, beware it lacks isolation and should only be done in trusted environments where nobody has access to create or edit naughty Jenkins builds.
