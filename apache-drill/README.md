Apache Drill
============

https://drill.apache.org/

Schema-free SQL Query Engine for Hadoop, NoSQL and Cloud Storage

Starts a single Apache Drillbit and maps port 8047 which you can browse to for Drill UI.

If started interactively will drop in to a SQL shell.

```
docker run -ti -p 8047:8047 harisekhon/apache-drill
```

or with docker-compose:

```
docker-compose up
```

or without `docker-compose`, a shortcut for the docker run command:

```
make run
```
